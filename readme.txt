Gives administrators the ability to add notes to posts of any post type (including pages) that are prominently displayed for users editing the site.

== Description ==

Have you ever created a page template that just aggregated posts of a custom post type? Pretty cool huh?

Well, your client won’t think it’s that cool 2 months from now when they’re editing their site. They click “edit page” *and it’s blank!*.

Now you can add notes and links on these pages that will give your clients, authors or other editors, clear directions when editing their site. Check out the screenshots to see it in action.
